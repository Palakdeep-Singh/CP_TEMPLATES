<p align="center"><h1> 🚀 Competitive Programming Templates</h1></p>

A curated collection of C++ templates designed to boost speed, reduce boilerplate, and provide ready-to-use snippets for competitive programming contests.


## **📌 Why This Repo?**
Competitive programming is all about speed + accuracy. Writing the same utility functions repeatedly wastes precious time. This repo solves that by providing:
- Pre-written templates for common algorithms and data structures.
- Fast I/O setups to handle large inputs efficiently.
- Debugging helpers to quickly trace logic errors.
- Modular code snippets for reuse across problems.


## **⚡ Features (ASAP)**
- **Fast I/O:** Optimized input/output routines for handling big test cases.
- **Macros & Shortcuts:** Reduce typing overhead with clean, reusable macros.
- **Data Structures:** Templates for segment trees, Fenwick trees, DSU, heaps, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms:** BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, etc.
- **Math Utilities:** Modular arithmetic, prime sieves, combinatorics, matrix exponentiation.
- **String Algorithms:** KMP, Z-function, rolling hash, suffix arrays.
- **Debugging Tools:** Handy debug macros for tracing variables during contests.

## **🛠️ Usage**
 1. Clone the repo: 
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Palakdeep-Singh/CP_TEMPLATES.git
cd CP_TEMPLATES
```
2. Copy the required template into your contest file.
3. Compile and run:
 ```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp -o main
./main
```
